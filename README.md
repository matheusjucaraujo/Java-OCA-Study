# Java-OCA-Study

The objective of this repository is to study for the Oracle Certified Associate Exam (OCA) for Java 8 and to get more used to git in general. The Read Me file will contain information about each segment that I think it's important in the study guide written by Jeanne Boyarsky and Scott Selikoff. There will be several classes written in java for each lesson that is important to learn for the exam as well, they will be separeted by packages for each chapter of the guide.

##Understanding the Java Class Structure

###Fields and Methods

Java classes have two primary elements and are caled members of the class: Methods and Fields. 
Methods can be also know as functions or procedures. A method is a set of code which is referred to by name and can be called (invoked) at any point in a program simply by utilizing the method's name.  Think of a method as a subprogram that acts on data and often returns a value.

Fields are generally knows as variables. Variables is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. Typically, a program consists of instruction s that tell the computer what to do and data that the program uses when it is running.
